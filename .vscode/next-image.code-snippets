	// Place your global snippets here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a scope, prefix, body and
	// description. Add comma separated ids of the languages where the snippet is applicable in the scope field. If scope
	// is left empty or omitted, the snippet gets applied to all languages. The prefix is what is
	// used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders.
	// Placeholders with the same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	"Create new Next image": {
		"scope": "markdown, .md, .mdx",
		"prefix": "image",
		"body": [
			"<Image",
			"path={`/photos/${1:src}.jpeg`}",
			"caption={`${2:alt}`}",
			"${3:vertical}",
			"${4:thin}",
			"${5:fill}",
			"${6:priority}",
			"/>",
			"\n$0"
		],
		"description": "Wrapper for Next image component"
	}
}
