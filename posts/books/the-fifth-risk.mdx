   Michael lewis's latest book is an enjoyable behind-the-scenes look at the
   federal government's lesser-known yet critical functions. But the "unsung
   heroes of the deep-state" approach is uncritical in a number of dangerous
   ways.

_The Fifth Risk_ is a largely enjoyable, highly readable, and relatively short
foray into the lives of career bureaucrats. The people, as Michael Lewis writes,
who are "in it for the mission" but “couldn’t or wouldn’t defend themselves.”

Published almost exactly two years after President Trump was elected in 2016,
Lewis's account is one of the more creative ways the publishing industry took
immediate stock of the country under Trump's tenure. Less so a voyeuristic,
tabloid-esque "room where it happened" (which also happens to be the title of
John Bolton's latest book), and more so a good faithed attempt at understanding
the sprawling bureaucracy that is the federal executive branch, Lewis's book
provides a number of good insights, with a few gaping flaws.

The book is only three chapters long, each assessing a different department: The
Department of Energy, The Department of Agriculture, and The Department of
Commerce, respectively. The stories, however, are personal. The book is about
the role of government, but it is told through interviews with the people who
actually run it.

The approach makes the mind-numbing topic far more engaging. We sit in the
living room of Art Allen, who wrote _Review of Leeway_, the most sophisticated
technique ever designed to find people and vessels stranded at sea, saving the
lives of multiple people each day. We talk to DJ Patil, who as a young man,
hacked NOAA's weather data to write his ground-breaking dissertation, and then
some 15 years later, was personally invited by President Obama to return as the
country's U.S. Chief Data Scientist. We meet Kathy Sullivan, the first female
astronaut to walk in space walk, and
([just this year](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/08/science/challenger-deep-kathy-sullivan-astronaut.html))
became the first woman to explore Challenger Deep, the deepest crevasse of the
Mariana Trench.

All of these people are remarkable. And Lewis's book is a wonderful testament to
them--and tens of thousands just like them--who at the nadir of Trump's attack
of "the establishment," are well deserving of some recognition. More
importantly, however, _The Fifth Risk_ shows just how important the federal
government is writ large. Even as an avowed leftist, who almost exclusively
believes in _more_ government, I was surprised to learn how much the federal
government does, yet seemingly receives no credit for.

[For instance, Elon Musk, ](https://newrepublic.com/article/160500/elon-musks-big-government-grift)
has benefitted from “$4.9 billion in government support.”

Reading the book at the end of 2020, the book can feel all too prescient. Not
even twenty pages in, he reminds the reader of the risks “so remote as to be
unreal," which include cyberattacks, violent revolutions, and "some airborne
virus wiped out millions.” There can be no doubt that Trump's willful ignorance
of even the most basic functions of government have cost 100's of thousands of
lives.

Some of Lewis's assumptions are laughably naive. He argues that "the rift in
American life [and government] wasn't between Republicans and Democrats" but
"between the people who were in it for the mission, and the people who were in
it for the money." You don't have to convince me that there are plenty of
Democrats in it for the money. The executive suite of almost every tech giant
compromises at least one former-Obama White House staffer.

-  Former press secretary Jay Carney is head of PR at Amazon
-  Head of EPA Lisa Jackson is now a VP at Apple

...

But this idea that what separates the good from the bad is just "their sense of
mission" does not strike

David Freidberg, The Climate Corporation - "All of these had just been tools for
the farmer to use. None of them had replaced the farmer... Everything will be
observed. Everything will be predicted."

There's a word for the foible of this book: _solutionism_. Solutionism is the
can-do attitude gone awry, is the idea that political, cultural, and moral
dilemmas can be recast as uncontroversial and easily managed matters of
technological efficiency.

The adage goes "if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail."

The very title of the book, _The Fifth Risk_, is a reference to "project
management," which according to Lewis is "the existential threat you never even
really imagine as a threat." That "project management" could ever be existential
feels like textbook Silicon Valley thinking to me. Of all the existential
aspects of the Trump presidency to choose from (even only two years in),
"project management" seems woefully misplaced.

I've maintained since the early days of Trump's presidency that his tenure was
less of a threat than _the fact that he was elected in the first place_. It was
apparent to me early on that he was simply too inept to actually bend the
government to his will, however abhorrent his will typically was. _The fact of
his election_, however, still deeply troubles me, in part because we still seem
to have done so little reckoning with it.
