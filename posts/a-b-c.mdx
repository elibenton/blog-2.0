   For decades, sanctuary cities have existed for those two reasons: public
   safety and public trust. For those same reasons, they’ve been remarkably
   uncontroversial until only recently. No one thinks sanctuary cities are a
   permanent solution. They are a necessary reaction — a reaction to complete
   failure from every branch of the Federal Government to address the crises of
   our immigration system.

This wonderful [^1] and acerbic criticism by Rose Eveleth in Vox came out in October,
and actually prompted some much needed conversation online, albeit not enough in
my opinion. My favorite aspect of the piece was her implicit criticism of "the
progress narrative," the idea that all history moves in a straight line which
invariably points up. In such a world such as this, all change is good
change–any change necessarily has to be a good change. It's a convenient
framework for Silicon Valley because it excuses both pollyannaish predictions of
the future and willful misinterpretation of the past.

> Technologists’ desire to make a parallel to evolution is flawed at its very foundation. Evolution is driven by random mutation — mistakes, not plans... Evolution doesn’t have meetings about the market, the environment, the customer base. Evolution doesn’t patent things or do focus groups. Evolution doesn’t spend millions of dollars lobbying Congress to ensure that its plans go unfettered.

> This idea persists in part because Americans cannot resist the allure of “progress”

> This endless, punishing race in the name of “progress” is often what drives consumer behavior, too. Despite the “American dream” — security, safety, prosperity — being more and more out of reach for everyday Americans, the idea that it’s just around the corner drives people to purchase these products.

This piece from September continues to remain relevant as India–the country who
has shut off the internet more than any other in history–did it again in the
wake protest against its new discriminatory citizenship laws. I'll admit, I'm
kicking myself for leaving India right as this long-simmering tension came to a
head. I remember speaking to Jean Dréze, a well-regarded economist and activist
within the country, at a conference in Raipur in September. He suggested I look
at all the ways technology would be wielded to coerce India from a secular
nation to one of religiously and ethnically tiered citizenship. I didn't have
the time to flesh out the idea into a full-blown investigation, but internet
shutdowns will invariably remain a key tool for despotically-inclined
governments around the world (the US and UK should perhaps pay attention before
the issue gets more personal).
