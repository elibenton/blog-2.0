I was listening to
[a podcast](https://longform.org/posts/longform-podcast-376-kevin-kelly) a few
weeks ago—I do that a lot these days—and about an hour into a conversation I had
been thoroughly enjoying (and largely agreeing with), the guest said something
that made my blood boil. The guest was Kevin Kelly, the founder of WIRED
magazine.

“It’s a fallacy called thinkism,” he began his grand theory. “Thinkism,”
according to Kelly, is when people sit around and claim they can think up
solutions to problems. Hah! The naiveté!

He went on to pantomime his opposition: “‘Oh, people should have known that
social media would cause disinformation.’ No! You can’t figure that out by
thinking about it… Complex things, like technology, and all the things we are
making with these technologies, like artificial intelligence, we cannot figure
out by _thinking_ about them.”

Had I been the interviewer, this is the first place I’d have interjected. He
obviously hasn’t _thought_ much about who “the thinkists” really are, because he
is already misrepresenting their arguments. It’s not that technologists should
have been able to _predict_ that social media would reek such havoc; it’s simply
that they should have _thought about it long enough to wonder if it would_. It’s
a low bar— still missed.

Kelly continues, “We can only figure it out by _using_ it… Unless you engage
with technology, you can’t steer it.” It’s interesting to note that Kelly never
uses the phrase, “learning by doing,” the hallmark of the “doerism” ethos. The
value in “learning by doing” is self-evident, but the practice also contains the
seed of its own demise. Maker-spaces, hacker culture, design thinking all share
a common denominator—things have to break before you can know how they work.

Some forethought could have predicted the consequences of “scaling up” this
ethos. If you break your Arduino or your start-up tanks, it’s reasonable to cut
your losses, learn from your mistakes, and try again. But “doerism” has
developed a pejorative connotation over the past decades. Why? The “doers” have
managed to break a lot of things: the global financial market, democratic
elections, entire systems of truth making. These may sound like overstated
claims, but none of those systems broke of their own accord. Laws and
regulations were bent and/or ignored to make room for innovation*.* Then again,
perhaps the doers learned something while they broke all these things? But it’s
hard to know, they certainly aren’t sharing.

Kelly is espousing “doerism” whether he openly claims that label or not. I am
actually as enthralled by Kevin Kelly as I am upset by him (which, yes, is
representative of my fascination in tech writ large). I first learned of Kelly
in southern India, hours lost into the top floor of _Blossom Book House_, the
dustiest used bookshop in Bangalore. My friend Romanshi, who took me to
_Blossom_, rates her bookshops by how many Claritin she has to take beforehand;
_Blossom_ comes out on top

It was in _Blossom_ that I found Kelly’s book, _What Technology Wants_. There I
learned that Kelly spent seven years wandering Asia as a young man. “What a
coincidence!?” I thought to myself. Perhaps there is something about clueless,
White, American men in Asia that inevitably leads to philosophizing cyberspace!
But not far into the book, I realized that theory could only hold so much water.
Interest in technology is where our similarities seemed to end.

Kelly assumes a
[teleological reverence](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/07/books/review/Coyne-t.html)
for technology. He invents his own word (I see a trend) to define the “global,
massively interconnected system of technology vibrating around us,” the
_Technium_. The wants of the _Technium_—much like the will of God— he argues,
are beyond our comprehension, much less our control.

In the face of technological inevitability, what value does thinking hold? The
answer is none; every hour dedicated to thinking is an hour delaying
technology’s inescapable progress. In this strange pseudo-Darwinian,
pseudo-Creationist paradigm, the only logical course of action is, well, action.
Do. Repeat. Where I disagree with Kelly is his premiss. Technology does not
behave like biology, and it certainly doesn’t have divine will.  There is no
progressive evolution of machines. I think of what Rose Eveleth
[wrote in Vox](https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/10/1/20887003/tech-technology-evolution-natural-inevitable-ethics)
in October of last year:

> Evolution is driven by random mutation — mistakes, not plans... Evolution
> doesn’t have meetings about the market, the environment, the customer base.
> Evolution doesn’t patent things or do focus groups. Evolution doesn’t spend
> millions of dollars lobbying Congress to ensure that its plans go unfettered.

To be sure, all this talk of “progressive evolution” and “only do” is all a bit
weird coming from Kelly, a man who has written eight books and edited two
magazines, but has never built a product or invented anything other than ideas.
Perhaps Kelly disdains the “thinkists” like I disdain the “doists”—we both
secretly fear we are really more like the other one.

Such is the danger of reading too much into a person's single statement. So how
about two?

Earlier in the interview, before all his talk of doing and thinking, Kelly
shares what he believes is the meaning of life: “finding the _one_ thing that
only you can do.” Kelly is probably more mathematically proficient than I, but I
typically conjecture that at least 1% of humanity is just as, if not more,
talented than I am (I know, salt-of-the-earth). Considering that we number seven
billion and counting, my math works out to, you know, seventy million. It's a
far cry from Kelly's lone ranger.

Kelly actually ends the interview by revealing what his life’s task is, the one
thing that he alone can do: world governance. After many days of shock and
outrage, I’ve actually been able to temper my reaction. It’s very poetic. I’d
love for Kelly to keep _thinking_ about his “global… sentient being.” I’d love
for him to keep thinking about it, writing about it, debating over it,
experimenting with it. In short, I’m not _against_ his “one machine,” what he
calls the “holos, unity, emergent, planetary... thing.”

I just hope, unlike those who came before him, he thinks it through a bit longer
before building it.
