   Michael lewis's latest book is an entertaining behind-the-scenes look at the
   federal government's lesser-known yet critical functions. But the "unsung
   heroes of the deep-state" approach is uncritical in a number of dangerous
   ways.

_The Fifth Risk_ is a largely enjoyable, highly readable, and relatively short
foray into the lives of career bureaucrats. The people, as Michael Lewis writes,
who are "in it for the mission" but “couldn’t or wouldn’t defend themselves.”

Published almost exactly two years after President Trump was elected in 2016,
Lewis's account is one of the more creative ways the publishing industry took
immediate stock of the country under Trump's tenure. The book is less a
voyeuristic, tabloid-esque "room where it happened" (yes, that is the title of
John Bolton's latest book), and more a good faithed attempt at understanding the
sprawling bureaucracy that is the federal executive branch. There are numerous
inspiring stories, a few good insights, and one gaping flaw.

The book is only three chapters long (with prologue and afterword), each
assessing a different federal department: The Department of Energy, The
Department of Agriculture, and The Department of Commerce, respectively. The
book is about the role of government, but it is told through heartwarming
interviews with the people who actually run it.

The approach makes the mind-numbing topic of professional bureaucracy far more
engaging. We sit in the living room of Art Allen, who wrote _Review of Leeway_,
the most sophisticated technique ever designed to find people and vessels
stranded at sea, saving the lives of multiple people each day. We talk to DJ
Patil, who as a young man, hacked NOAA's weather data to write his
ground-breaking dissertation, and then some 15 years later, was personally
invited by President Obama to return as the country's Chief Data Scientist. We
meet Kathy Sullivan, the first female astronaut to walk in space walk, and
([just this year](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/08/science/challenger-deep-kathy-sullivan-astronaut.html))
became the first woman to explore Challenger Deep, the deepest crevasse of the
Mariana Trench.

All of these people are remarkable. And Lewis's book is a wonderful testament to
them--and tens of thousands just like them--who at the height of Trump's attack
on "the establishment," are well deserving of some recognition. More
importantly, however, _The Fifth Risk_ shows just how important the federal
government is writ large. Even as an avowed leftist, who almost reflexively
believes in _more_ government, I was surprised to learn how much these
departments do, yet seemingly never receive credit for.

For instance, I learned that Elon Musk, the quixotic, billionaire Silicon Valley
mogul, launched Telsa with a
[half billion dollar loan from the Department of Energy](https://newrepublic.com/article/160500/elon-musks-big-government-grift)--a
low-interest loan specifically designed to buoy innovative business that private
banks refuse to finance. It's estimated that between tax benefits and special
development programs, Musk has benefitted in from “$4.9 billion in government
support.” “Every Tesla you see on the road came from a facility financed by the
DOE” writes Lewis. In fact, the majority of the technologies Silicon Valley
companies have made trillions from were made in federal agencies: GPS, Internet
Protocol, and Artificial Intelligence, just to name a few.

The title of the book, _The Fifth Risk_, is a reference to "project management,"
which according to Lewis is "the existential threat you never even really
imagine as a threat." He basically is arguing that the federal government is
going to fall into complete mismanagement, and that even if Trump was too
incompetent to take over the country, the vacuum left by his lack of leadership
will destroy it all the same. What happens when none of these tasks are done,
when none of these risks are prepared for?

Well, reading the book at the end of 2020, it feels all too prescient. Not even
twenty pages in, Lewis reminds the reader of the risks “so remote as to be
unreal," which include cyberattacks, violent revolutions, and "some airborne
virus wiping out millions.” It was actually only months before _The Fifth Risk_
was published that the government's
[pandemic response team was entirely dissolved](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2018/05/10/top-white-house-official-in-charge-of-pandemic-response-exits-abruptly/)
by national security adviser John Bolton. These pre-pandemic decisions, often
made in the name of cost-cutting, and almost every inexcusable blunder by the
White House since has led to the death of tens if not hundreds of thousands of
people who should still be alive.

The government's handling of Covid-19 would make a compelling addendum to _The
Fifth Risk_, but even so, I have to wonder if Lewis has really identified the
correct problem. If Trump's inability to "project manage" is the cause, why do
Italy, Spain, The United Kingdom, and Belgium all have higher rates of
infection?

Does managerial efficiency really account for the disparities between western
democracies

-  Taiwan - 7 Deaths
-  New Zealand - 25 Deaths
-  China - 4,634
-  South Korea - 819
-  Vietnam - 35

Some of Lewis's assumptions are laughably naive. He argues that "the rift in
American life [and government] wasn't between Republicans and Democrats" but
"between the people who were in it for the mission, and the people who were in
it for the money." You don't have to convince me that there are plenty of
Democrats in it for the money. The executive suite of almost every tech giant
compromises at least one former-Obama White House staffer.

-  Former campaign manager David Plouffe became an EVP at Uber
-  Former press secretary Jay Carney is head of PR at Amazon
-  Head of EPA Lisa Jackson is now a VP at Apple

...

But this idea that what separates the good from the bad is just "their sense of
mission" does not bode well for me.

There's a word for the foible of this book: _solutionism_. Solutionism is the
can-do attitude gone awry, is the idea that political, cultural, and moral
dilemmas can be recast as uncontroversial and easily managed matters of
technological efficiency.

The adage goes "if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail."

That "project management" could ever be existential feels like textbook Silicon
Valley thinking to me. Of all the existential aspects of the Trump presidency to
choose from (even only two years in), "project management" seems woefully
misplaced.

I've maintained since the early days of Trump's presidency that his tenure was
less of a threat than _the fact that he was elected in the first place_. It was
apparent to me early on that he was simply too inept to actually bend the
government to his will, however abhorrent his will typically was. _The fact of
his election_, however, still deeply troubles me, in part because we still seem
to have done so little reckoning with it.

-  Facebook
-  Economic Inequality vs. Racism
-  Disdain of Elites

Much of his success was attributed to Facebook.

"Project Management" may be the fifth risk, but risks one through four, and
frankly, a good many more, should probably be of greater concern.
